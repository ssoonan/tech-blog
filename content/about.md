I work at the intersection of cloud-native technologies and real-time systems. My research focuses on applying container orchestration—leveraging the benefits of container tools like Docker and Kubernetes to safety-critical edge environments where traditional cloud assumptions about infinite resources and throughput-focused optimization no longer apply.

My perspective comes from working across the full stack, from scaling backend systems in production to implementing kernel-level scheduling policies. This full-stack experience revealed a fundamental tension: cloud-native tools are designed for flexibility and developer productivity, while embedded systems demand predictability and resource efficiency. I believe that next-generation infrastructure environments, such as robotics and Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs), must rethink both sides of this equation

Currently, I am working on two projects, extending Kubernetes to support real-time workloads in automotive applications and developing Kubernetes device plugin and monitoring system for Hailo NPU. I write about the technical challenges, design tradeoffs, and lessons learned from bringing these two worlds together.
