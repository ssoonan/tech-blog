I work at the intersection of cloud-native technologies and real-time embedded systems. My research focuses on bringing container orchestration to safety-critical edge environments where traditional cloud assumptions about infinite resources and acceptable latency no longer hold

My perspective comes from working across the stack, from scaling backend systems in production to implementing kernel-level scheduling policies. This cross-layer experience revealed a fundamental tension: cloud-native tools are designed for flexibility and developer productivity, while embedded systems demand predictability and resource efficiency. I believe the future of edge computing requires rethinking both sides of this equation

Currently, I am working on two projects, extending Kubernetes to support real-time workloads in automotive applications and developing Kubernetes device plugin and monitoring system for Hailo NPU. I write about the technical challenges, design tradeoffs, and lessons learned from bringing these two worlds together.
