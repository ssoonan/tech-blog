I'm a systems engineer who extracts twice the value, or more, from the same hardware.  
At Seoul National University, I researched real-time systems, virtualization, and Kubernetes while specializing in operating systems. 

Over four years across three startups, handling everything from business planning to infrastructure development, one question kept surfacing. Are we truly utilizing our computing resources. Whether selecting a PC for parking barrier systems or configuring AWS instances for servers, the same doubt followed me. Building infrastructure without understanding the underlying principles inevitably led to excessive spending.

Using identical hardware, AWS Lambda generates at least five times more revenue than EC2, and the answer lies in higher utilization. This principle remains unchanged with GPUs and NPUs. I aim to become an engineer who utilizes hardware more efficiently by understanding the entire stack, from kernel level to application layer.

After graduating in the first half of 2026, I want to directly address resource optimization challenges in large-scale systems within cloud infrastructure or platform engineering.
