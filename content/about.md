I am a systems engineer focused on computing resource efficiency through vertical integration of hardware and software. I am currently a master's student at Seoul National University researching real-time computing and container orchestration, expecting to graduate in the first half of 2026.

Before entering graduate school at age 30, I spent four years across three startups in roles ranging from business planning to infrastructure development. During those years, I repeatedly encountered the same questions: when selecting PCs for parking lot barriers or choosing AWS EC2 instances, I wondered whether we were truly utilizing the full capacity of our computing resources. Why did it cost so much? Could we achieve the same results more efficiently?

The greatest irony in modern IT is that despite exponential growth in computing power, most organizations fail to properly utilize their resources. I believe this stems from engineers being confined to their own domains. Developers focus solely on software, hardware engineers lack software knowledge, and cloud engineers work with abstracted instances without looking beneath the surface. Real efficiency emerges when you understand the entire stack. This is precisely why companies like Apple and Tesla design hardware and software together.

As the AI era accelerates, computational demand is exploding, yet energy costs and environmental concerns prevent unlimited hardware expansion. Someone must find ways to use existing resources more efficiently. I intend to be that someone.

After graduation, I aim to build my career in cloud infrastructure companies or platform engineering teams, directly addressing resource optimization challenges in large-scale systems. If we can accomplish ten times more work with the same hardware, that represents more than cost savings. It means making technology accessible to more people.
